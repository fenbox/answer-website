Discussions are always going in Apache Answer. How can you find the information you need in all these conversations? Try to search! Answer provides ways for you to search the information you need, and let’s equip you with all the search tips.

## Search Bar

The search bar locates at the top of every page. Whether you’re browsing on the homepage, or taking a closer look at a post, you can always type and search for the content you require.

## Start from a Keyword

Just like a search engine, let’s start searching in Answer with a single keyword. Then, you can refine your search by making it to a phrase or sentence. In Answer, we [highlight the key terms](https://answer.apache.org/blog/what-is-new-in-apache-answer-1.3.0/#fine-tunings-youll-love) so that you can identify it with just a glance.

You can also sort the results with **Active, Newest, Relevance, and Score** to better hunt down the content you need.

## Search with Tag

Remember the [magical tag](https://answer.apache.org/blog/how-to-build-a-help-center-with-your-users-and-answer#03-organize-categories-with-tags) that play a big role in organizing the community? They’re powerful for tracking the content. If you’re looking for content in the same category, searching with a relevant tag is a productive way to start with.

Simply type the tag name inside square brackets and hit search, e.g., [Release].

## Advanced Search Tips

Besides keyword and tags, Answer provides multiple ways to search to meet your needs.

- Search by author with: **user:username**
- Find unanswered questions with: **answers:0**
- Look for a post with a score with: **score: score number**

Don’t panic if you forget the rules. The advanced search tips are displayed on the right side whenever you’re searching.
