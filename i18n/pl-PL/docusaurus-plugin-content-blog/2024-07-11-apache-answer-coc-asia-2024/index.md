Attendees can learn about Apache's latest breakthrough, upcoming innovations, and insights from community-driven projects guided by the Apache way, while exploring Apache's ecosystem, business models, legal issues, and more. The full breakout session schedule can be viewed [here](https://asia.communityovercode.org/schedule.html).

As an incubating project, Apache Answer is always open to communication and collaboration. We started our CommunityOverCode Asia journey from a booth last year, and this year we’re back with not just the booth, but **two sessions, and one keynote**.

## See You in Our Sessions

Last year, Apache Answer passed the vote and entered the incubator. We’ve been receiving help from the community, including but not limited to documentations, PRs, and meetup. Time for us to give it back to the open-source world.

Follow PPMC member LinkinStar, backend engineer, to look back at our first Apache release, how we settled down, and how the community nail the challenges. Dive with Anne Zhu, marketing specialist, for a closer look at Apache Answer with practical how-tos to engage your community members. Don’t forget to join Nadia and Anne for their keynote on non-code contributions within the open-source ecosystem.

### Incubator Track

This track provides insights on the incubator journey, Apache’s governance, and operations. Participants will learn about advancing from incubation to a Top-Level Project (TLP) and strategies for building a diverse, compliant open-source community.

#### The Journey from Incubation to First Release: Unveiling the Apache Answer Release Way

Speaker: LinkinStar\
Apache Answer PPMC Member, architect of SegmentFault, and Golang backend expert.

Join me as I share Answer's journey—from the transformative insights gained by participating in open source, through the story-rich donation process to Apache, to the challenging yet rewarding path to our first release. Discover how open source reshaped my understanding, the collaborative efforts behind Answer's integration into the Apache Software Foundation, and the persistence needed to navigate the complexities of launching our initial version. This session is a concise exploration of lessons learned and the unyielding spirit of the open-source community.

### Community Track

Why does ASF believe in "Community over Code"? There is more to open-source than just code contribution. In this track, let’s explore topics like governance models, growing project communities, diversity and inclusion, community health metrics, management tools, project roadmaps, case studies, and sustaining open-source communities.
