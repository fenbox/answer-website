Apache Answer has [graduated from the Apache Incubator](https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-announces-new-top-level-projects) to become a Top-Level Project (TLP).

Apache Answer is a modern, open source Q&A platform designed to help organizations build their knowledge base and community. The software enables teams and communities to collaboratively create, share, and discover knowledge in a structured and efficient way.

"Apache Answer's graduation as a Top-Level Project marks a significant milestone in our journey," said Ning Qi, Vice President of Apache Answer. "This achievement reflects the dedication of our community and the maturity of our platform in providing a Q&A platform solution for knowledge management and community engagement."

Since its inception in October 2022, Apache Answer has gained significant traction in the open-source community, with contributions from over 80 developers who have collaboratively addressed hundreds of issues and pull requests. This active engagement demonstrates the project's vitality and commitment to continuous improvement, showcasing the power of collaborative open-source development.

## Advantages of Apache Answer

Apache Answer offers key features to enhance knowledge sharing and community engagement.

### Easy and Intuitive Q&A Community

Apache Answer offers an intuitive setup for newcomers, enabling them to quickly set up a Q&A platform with helpful documentation. Its design allows effortless question-asking and answering, fostering community engagement on both mobile and desktop devices.

### Efficient Content Management

Administrators can use tags to categorize questions, allowing community members to easily search and find relevant information. By following tags, users can always stay updated on their interested content and display them in the way they need.

### Add Wings with Plugin

Users can enhance Apache Answer by adding or extending features through plugins, allowing customization to fit specific workflows. This flexibility enables integration with third-party systems, improving adaptability and performance.

### Reputation Scores and Incentives

Apache Answer features a reputation system that rewards users for contributing quality content, accepting top answers, and receiving votes. This encourages content quality, fosters credibility, and promotes a sense of accomplishment within the community.

In the future, with continuous contributions from the open-source community, Apache Answer is expected to evolve, introducing new features and enhancements that will further expand its capabilities and meet diverse user needs.
