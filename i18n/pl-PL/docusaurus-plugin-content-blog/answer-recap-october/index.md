# Recap of October | Apache Answer

Hope you enjoyed the spooky vibe of the Halloween. Hereâ€™s your October newsletter filled with chilling delights!

## ðŸ«¶ Community

New award coming!
We have received the award of cutting-edge open source projects and communities presented by China Communications Standards Association. Apache Answer has impressed the judges with its strong community, global reach, and technical flexibility, as shown in the preliminary round and the second round of interviews.

The community gets bigger!
Give it up for our new committer: [Qirui Song](https://github.com/sosyz). He contributed a lark notification plugin and shared his notes in his [blog](https://blog.sonui.cn/development-notes-for-apache-answer-plugin/#more).

Besides, he also helped with bug fixes and code quality improvement. Weâ€™re so glad to have such a versatile and active person joining the family.

OSPP goes well so far.
Our mentors have reviewed the merged PR/MR from the students and wait for the final evaluation from the committee.

## Coming up Next

1.4.1 is now in the voting process and will be released in November. Have a [sneak peek](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/releases/tag/untagged-e895d4ea9fba53a1cc5e) for the new version.
