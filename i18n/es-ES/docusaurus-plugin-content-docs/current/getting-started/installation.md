## Start Apache Answer

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

There are multiple ways to start Apache Answer, you can choose the one that suits you best.

<Tabs queryString="method">
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker compose" default>

We recommend using Docker Compose to run Apache Answer. This is the easiest way to get started with Apache Answer.

:::tip

If you are using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on Windows or Mac, docker-compose is already included. If you are using Linux, you will need to install docker-compose separately.

:::  

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/answer/main/docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -p answer -f - up
```

The default port for Apache Answer is `9080`. You can access it at http://localhost:9080.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

You can find all the available Docker images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/answer/tags). The `latest` tag refers to the latest stable version of Apache Answer.

```bash
docker run -d -p 9080:80 -v answer-data:/data --name answer apache/answer:latest
```

After running the command, heading to http://localhost:9080/install to continue installation.

:::tip

If you can't access the installation page, you can use the command `docker logs answer` to view the logs. It may help you find the specific problem.

As a golang project, Apache Answer can be compiled into a binary file. You can download the binary file that matches your operating system from the [release page](https://github.com/apache/answer/releases).

```

After running the command, heading to http://localhost:80/install to continue installation.

Follow the [Install Steps](#install-steps) to complete the installation. **After that** run the following command to start the answer again.

```bash

You can specify the port on which to start the installation by specifying the environment variable `INSTALL_PORT`, default is 80.

## Install steps

> After you start the answer, you can follow the steps below to complete the initialization about the basic configuration.

### Step 1: Choose the language

### Step 2: Config database

:::tip
Apache Answer supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite as the database backend. The smallest environment is SQLite, which does not require any additional configuration. If you want to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, you need to setup the database first and then configure the database connection in this step. Here we recommend using sqlite3 to complete your first experience.
