New version for a new release. In 1.3.6, we focus on user experience and performance. Whether you're managing a bustling community forum or building a custom Q&A solution, Answer 1.3.6 empowers you to create a more intuitive and efficient platform for everyone involved.

[Upgrade](https://answer.apache.org/docs/upgrade) now, and find out what we’ve got for you.

## What’s New

### Pre-fill Forms: Focus on the Content. Leave the Rest.

Introducing pre-fill forms, a feature that improves data accuracy and more concentration. By allowing you to pre-fill question fields with relevant information, you can significantly reduce user input and improve data accuracy.

It’s useful for:
Frequently asked questions: Pre-fill common question tags.
Customer support: Provide essential context for support tickets.

Follow the steps to build a pre-fill form for community members.

1. Add pre-fill information to the filed for the users.

### CDN Plugins: Speed it up!

Speaking of performance, Answer 1.3.6 offers two new CDN plugins: [Amazon CloudFront](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/cdn-s3) and [Aliyun CDN](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/cdn-aliyun). By integrating these plugins into your infrastructure, you can dramatically improve load times and enhance overall user experience. These plugins are by your side for handling increased traffic and faster content delivery.
