## 🔧 Improvements

- **Enhanced Readability:** Long code snippets can be challenging to read, but we’ve made improvements to ensure they’re more digestible.
- **Reminder Email Update:** We’ve added a "Do not reply directly" message to our reminder emails to avoid confusion. Thanks, @sosyz, for the suggestion!
- **SEO Enhancements:** We’ve optimized the user homepage for better search engine visibility.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- **Markdown Parsing Fix:** We resolved an issue where ordered list numbers were not incrementing correctly during markdown parsing.
- **Tag Display Exception:** The change list/unlist action now works smoothly without causing tag display exceptions.
- **Timezone Display Issue:** The timezone display on the Dashboard page has been corrected, ensuring it shows properly when set to UTC.
- **Content Duplication Fix:** We’ve resolved the duplication of content on the results page.
- **User Addition Fix:** The unexpected username length restriction in the Admin Panel has been lifted, allowing for smoother user additions.
