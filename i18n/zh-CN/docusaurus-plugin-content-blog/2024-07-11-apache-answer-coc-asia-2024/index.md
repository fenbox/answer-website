CommunityOverCode Asia 2024 将于 7 月 26 日至 28 日在杭州举行。

This year, the event features one main forum,15 sub-forums with over 150 experts and mentors. Attendees can learn about Apache's latest breakthrough, upcoming innovations, and insights from community-driven projects guided by the Apache way, while exploring Apache's ecosystem, business models, legal issues, and more. The full breakout session schedule can be viewed [here](https://asia.communityovercode.org/schedule.html).

As an incubating project, Apache Answer is always open to communication and collaboration. We started our CommunityOverCode Asia journey from a booth last year, and this year we’re back with not just the booth, but **two sessions, and one keynote**.

## See You in Our Sessions

Last year, Apache Answer passed the vote and entered the incubator. We’ve been receiving help from the community, including but not limited to documentations, PRs, and meetup. Time for us to give it back to the open-source world.

Follow PPMC member LinkinStar, backend engineer, to look back at our first Apache release, how we settled down, and how the community nail the challenges. Dive with Anne Zhu, marketing specialist, for a closer look at Apache Answer with practical how-tos to engage your community members. Don’t forget to join Nadia and Anne for their keynote on non-code contributions within the open-source ecosystem.

### Incubator 专题

This track provides insights on the incubator journey, Apache’s governance, and operations. Participants will learn about advancing from incubation to a Top-Level Project (TLP) and strategies for building a diverse, compliant open-source community.

#### Apache Answer 的首个 Apache 版本发布之路

讲者：LinkinStar｜Go 语言后端开发工程师，Apache Answer PPMC 成员

Join me as I share Answer's journey—from the transformative insights gained by participating in open source, through the story-rich donation process to Apache, to the challenging yet rewarding path to our first release. 你将了解到 Answer 从开源到进入孵化器，再到首次发布 Apache 版本的过程。通过我的演讲，你可以了解开源是如何重塑我的认知，我们为 Answer 进入 Apache 软件基金会孵化器所做的准备，以及我们如何解决在发布首个 Apache 版本过程中所遇到的困难。 This session is a concise exploration of lessons learned and the unyielding spirit of the open-source community.
