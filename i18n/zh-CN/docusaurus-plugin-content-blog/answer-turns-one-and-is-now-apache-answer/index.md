## Proudly Incubated at Apache Incubator
We realized that a long-term healthy community is important for an open-source project, and becoming an [Apache project](https://answer.apache.org/blog/answer-enters-apache-incubator/) will guide us there. Nurtured in the Apache Way, we will build a fair, diverse and inclusive community, while ship great features with the community.
