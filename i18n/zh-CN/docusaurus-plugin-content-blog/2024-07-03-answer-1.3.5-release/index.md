What a nice way to start this July strong with the new version! This is perhaps our very first time to release a new version in the very beginning of a month.

In this update, both users and admins have more freedom to customize, express, and view in the online community with new features. Find out how and why.

## Customize URLs with Base Path Parametrization

Time to personalize your Answer URL. You can now handle Answer website address by adding tags to URLs. It’s a great improvement for both the flexibility and ease of deployment for Answer.

## Express Your Attitude with Reactions

When you come across a question that aligns perfectly with your confusion, or a brilliant answer that wipes away your doubts, simply show your appreciation with the latest reaction.

## Better Content Showcase

We heard your [call](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/issues/84), and here we are. Now, knowledge sharing is at the next level with a new embed plugin. It helps to refer to relevant article, tutorials, coding snippets, etc.

After activate the [embed plugin](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/embed-basic), you can customize the title with a brief summary of the content, and then paste the URL of the content you are adding.\

It looks like this. Better than multiple cold links, right?\

## Tweaks and Fixes

We’ve made changes to the Active list to ensure it shows current and engaging posts. Old questions will be moved out automatically that are either created 180 days ago, or not received a new answer in the past 90 days. Now, your Answer always shows the most recent topics and discussion when clicking Active.

We understand the need for an easy email address update. Users can now request their email address to be updated through a simple process involving contacting an admin.
