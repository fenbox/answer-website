October also marks the 10th anniversary of Hacktoberfest, an annual month-long event that encourages open-source software contributions. Founded in 2014, Hacktoberfest encourages participants to make contributions and support open-source projects they love on GitHub. These contributions include coding, low code, and non-code contributions, encouraging more individuals to collaborate and be a part of the open-source community.

1. How to show my digital badges on my GitHub?

 Please use the following code to show your attained swag.
 ```html
   <p>
      <img src="https://api.vaunt.dev/v1/github/entities/{{github_username}}/achievements?format=svg&limit=3" width="350" />
    </p>
 ```

2. Why hasn't my badge appeared yet?

 The vaunt data pulls took place before the two issues were created. This results in at most a 24-hour delay in when the achievement will be awarded. The vaunt data pulls took place before the two issues were created. This results in at most a 24-hour delay in when the achievement will be awarded. Achievements would have shown up automatically in the next data pull without any intervention, but Vaunt went ahead and re-ran the data pull operations on our end to trigger the achievement grants.

3. Can I still get a badge if my issues aren't accepted?

 It’s hard to say this, but it’s a No. We appreciate your participation greatly. For various reasons, your suggested enhancement might not align with our roadmap or product direction as you may think. We recommend you start with a bug. A bug is a bug, and this will increase your chances of earning a badge.
