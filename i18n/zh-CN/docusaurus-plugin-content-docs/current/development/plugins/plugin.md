## Introduction

### Plugin template types

Currently we have three types of plugins:

- Backend plugin
- Standard UI plugin
- Builtin plugin

### Plugin type

We classify plugins into different types. Different types of plugins have different functions. Plugins of the same type have the same effect, but are implemented differently.

| Plugin Name  | Template Type      | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Connector    | Backend Plugin     | The Connector plugin helps us to implement third-party login functionality                             |
| Storage      | Backend Plugin     | The Storage plugin helps us to upload files to third-party storage.                    |
| Cache        | Backend Plugin     | Support for using different caching middleware.                                        |
| Search       | Backend Plugin     | Support for using search engines to speed up the search for question answers.          |
| User Center  | Backend Plugin     | Using the third-party user system to manage users.                                     |
| Notification | Backend Plugin     | The Notification plugin helps us to send messages to third-party notification systems. |
| Route        | Standard UI Plugin | Provides support for custom routing.                                                   |
| Editor       | Standard UI Plugin | Supports extending the markdown editor's toolbar.                                      |
| Captcha      | Standard UI Plugin | Provides support for captcha.                                                          |
| Reviewer     | Backend Plugin     | Allows customizing the reviewer functionality.                                         |
| Filter       | Backend Plugin     | Filter out illegal questions or answers. (coming soon)              |
| Render       | Standard UI Plugin | Parsers for different content formats. (coming soon)                |

## Create a Plugin

:::info

The **name** field in package.json is the name of the package we add dependencies to; do not use `_` to connect this field naming, please use `-`; for example:

"editor-chart" ✅\
"editor_chart" ❌

:::

1. Go to the `ui > src > plugin` directory of the project.

2. Execute the following commands in that directory:

```shell
npx create-answer-plugin <pluginName>
```

3. Select the type of plugin you want to create.

## Run the Plugin

### Run the Backend Plugin

1. First, execute `make ui` to compile the front-end code.

2. In the `cmd > answer > main.go` file, import your plugin.

   ```go
   import (
     answercmd "github.com/apache/incubator-answer/cmd"

     // Import the plugins
     _ "github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/my-plugin"
   )
   ```

3. Use `go mod edit` to add the plugin to the `go.mod` file.

   ```shell
   go mod edit -replace=github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/my-plugin=./ui/src/plugins/my-plugin
   ```

4. Update the dependencies.

   ```shell
   go mod tidy
   ```

5. Start the project.

   ```shell
   go run cmd/answer/main.go run -C ./answer-data
   ```

### Run the Standard UI Plugin

1. Go to the `ui` directory.

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```shell
   pnpm pre-install
   ```

3. Start the project.

   ```shell
   pnpm start
   ```

4. Refer to the [Run the Backend Plugin](/docs/development/plugins#debugging-plugins) and add the plugin to the project.

## Backend Plugin Development

### Implement the Base interface

The `Base` interface contains basic information about the plugin and is used to display.

```go
// Info presents the plugin information
type Info struct {
    Name        Translator
    SlugName    string
    Description Translator
    Author      string
    Version     string
    Link        string
}

// Base is the base plugin
type Base interface {
    // Info returns the plugin information
    Info() Info
}
```

:::caution

The `SlugName` of the plugin must be unique. Two plugins with the same `SlugName` will panic when registering.

:::

### Implement the function interface

:::note

Different plugin types require different interfaces of implementation.

For example, following is the `Connector` plugin interface.

:::

```go
type Connector interface {
    Base
    
    // ConnectorLogoSVG presents the logo in svg format
    ConnectorLogoSVG() string
    
    // ConnectorName presents the name of the connector
    // e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
    ConnectorName() Translator
    
    // ConnectorSlugName presents the slug name of the connector
    // Please use lowercase and hyphen as the separator
    // e.g. facebook, twitter, instagram
    ConnectorSlugName() string
    
    // ConnectorSender presents the sender of the connector
    // It handles the start endpoint of the connector
    // receiverURL is the whole URL of the receiver
    ConnectorSender(ctx *GinContext, receiverURL string) (redirectURL string)
    
    // ConnectorReceiver presents the receiver of the connector
    // It handles the callback endpoint of the connector, and returns the
    ConnectorReceiver(ctx *GinContext, receiverURL string) (userInfo ExternalLoginUserInfo, err error)
}
```

:::tip

`Translator` is a struct for translation. Please refer to [the documentation](/docs/development/plugins/plugin-translation) for details.

:::

### Implement the configuration interface

For details on the description of each configuration item, please refer to [the documentation](/docs/development/plugins/plugin-config).

```go
type Config interface {
    Base

    // ConfigFields returns the list of config fields
    ConfigFields() []ConfigField

    // ConfigReceiver receives the config data, it calls when the config is saved or initialized.
    // We recommend to unmarshal the data to a struct, and then use the struct to do something.
    // The config is encoded in JSON format.
    // It depends on the definition of ConfigFields.
    ConfigReceiver(config []byte) error
}
```

### Register initialization function

```go
import "github.com/apache/incubator-answer/plugin"

func init() {
    plugin.Register(&GitHubConnector{
        Config: &GitHubConnectorConfig{},
    })
}
```

## Standard UI plugin Development

The default configuration is as follows:

```yaml
slug_name: <slug_name> 
type: <type>
version: 0.0.1
author: 

```

```tsx
import i18nConfig from './i18n';
import Component from './Component';
import info from './info.yaml';

export default {
  info: {
    slug_name: info.slug_name,
    type: info.type, 
  },
  i18nConfig,
  component: Component, 
};
```

Among them, `type`、`slug_name` and `component` are required fields. `i18nConfig` and `hooks` are optional fields.

Currently the front end supports the following types of plugins:

- editor
- route
- captcha

### Editor plugin

Refer to [editor-chart](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/editor-chart) for details.

### Route plugin

The plugin configuration of the routing type adds the `route` field to the configuration file.

```yaml
slug_name: <slug_name>
route: /<route>
type: route
version: 0.0.1
author: 

```

```tsx
import i18nConfig from './i18n';
import Component from './Component';
import info from './info.yaml';

export default {
  info: {
    slug_name: info.slug_name,
    type: info.type,
    route: info.route,
  },
  i18nConfig,
  component: Component,
};
```

### Captcha plugin

Refer to [captcha-basic](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/captcha-basic) for details.

## Builtin plugin Development

It is not so different from React component, this plugin is more suitable for the following scenarios:

1. There are complex business logics that cannot be separated from the code (such as Oauth).
2. Some back-end plugins require UI support for business purposes (such as Search).
3. This plugin has extremely low requirements for developers and requires no additional configuration work.

### How to develop builtin plugin

1. **Get familiar with the directory structure**. Go to the `ui/src/plugins/builtin` directory and create a directory, such as Demo. Then refer to the existing plugins to create the necessary files to start development.

```txt
// ui/src/plugins/builtin
.
├── ...
├── Demo
      ├── i18n (language file)
            ├── en_US.yaml (default language required)
            ├── index.ts (required)
            ├── zh_CN.ts (any language you want to provide)
      ├── index.tsx (component required)
      ├── info.yaml (plugin information required)
      ├── services.ts (api)
```

2. Export the plugins you have just defined in the plugins list file `plugins/builtin/index.ts`

```ts
import Demo from './Demo'

export default {
  ...(exists plugins),
  Demo,
};
```

3. Now you can use the PluginRender component to render the just-defined plugin where you want it!

```ts
  <PluginRender
    type="connector"
    slug_name="third_party_connector"
  />
```

4. **Publish plugin**: initiate the PR process normally and describe the plugin function and scope of influence in detail.
