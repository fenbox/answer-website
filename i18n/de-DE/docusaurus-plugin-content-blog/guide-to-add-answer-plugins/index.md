Plugins are like a set of building blocks that you can freely combine to create the functionality you want. Adding plugins is an excellent way to extend Apache Answer's features. This article will provide a detailed guide on the installation steps, helping you easily add plugins and master the process of installing and using them.

## Download Plugins

1. Click [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main) to download the desired plugin from the official Apache Answer plugin repository.
2. Place the Plugin: Move the downloaded plugin files into the `./ui/src/plugins` directory of your project.
3. Plugin Type Reference: https://answer.apache.org/docs/development/plugins

_Important: The folder should be named "plugins," not "plugin."_

## Install Standard UI Plugin

1. In the terminal, run `cd ./ui` to navigate to the ui directory.
2. Install dependencies: Run `pnpm pre-install`.
3. Start the project: Run `pnpm start` to launch the development server.
4. Backend Plugin Setup: In a new terminal window, continue with the backend plugin installation steps.

## Install Backend Plugin

1. Compile Frontend Code:

- Linux/MacOS: Run `make ui`.
- Windows: Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build`.

2. Import Plugin: In the `cmd/answer/main.go` file, import the plugin (replace my-plugin with your plugin name):

```
import (
    answercmd "github.com/apache/incubator-answer/cmd"
    // Import the plugins
    _ "github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/my-plugin"
)
```

The image below shows examples with the editor-chart, editor-formula, and embed-basic plugins.

3. Update go.mod: Navigate back to the project root directory by running `cd ..`. Use `go mod edit` to add the plugin to the go.mod file:

```
go mod edit -replace=github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/my-plugin=./ui/src/plugins/my-plugin
```

Note: Windows users need to use double quotes, as shown below:

```
go mod edit -replace="github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/my-plugin"="./ui/src/plugins/my-plugin"
```

Example with the editor-chart, editor-formula, and embed-basic plugins.
